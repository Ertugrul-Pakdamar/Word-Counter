Algorithms are the cornerstone of computer science and software development. An algorithm is a logical procedure that defines a collection of steps to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. Algorithms form the foundation of all types of information processing and data analysis processes. Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to analyze and classify the performance of algorithms.
